/// Regression guard for the exact bug this shape broke on once already:
/// two `resolveVerbIndexStatements` calls concatenated directly against a
/// fragment with no trailing space produced the single malformed token
/// `endifvlist`, which fails to lex/parse cleanly - and since the *whole*
/// eval (this plus its own tag/notify epilogue) runs as one MOO statement
/// sequence, that failure meant no response ever came back at all, not a
/// visible compile error - live-verification found it as an indefinite
/// hang. Parsing the generated statements directly (no live MOO
/// connection needed) catches a concatenation-spacing regression here
/// without needing the live-only scratch-verb round trip itself.
