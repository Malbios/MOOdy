<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Starts a headless, fully isolated test stack (MOO server, Sidecar, LSP server, Client) for
    automated/Playwright-driven testing - separate from the dev/play world that test.ps1 opens in
    visible Windows Terminal tabs.

.DESCRIPTION
    Copies survive.db (kept up to date by the dev world's own save-on-shutdown) to
    survive.test.db and boots the MOO server against that copy, with no visible console window.

    Isolation is structural, not just the MOO process: the Sidecar (which owns all git-based
    version control - eval() over a wizard connection, no MOO-side file writes since $vcs was
    retired) is pointed at a dedicated scratch git tree, TestScratchTree, built fresh every run by
    exporting whatever's actually live on this run's test MOO instance (via `Sidecar.exe export`) -
    never a real content repo like Survive. This is what test-instance-start.ps1 got wrong before:
    it only ever isolated the MOO server's own port, while every manual Sidecar/LSP/Client launch
    for verification kept defaulting to whatever real tree happened to be configured.

    Every service is launched as a single, directly-tracked OS process (no `dotnet watch`/`npm run
    dev` wrapper layers, which leave orphaned children behind when killed) - Sidecar.exe and
    LanguageServer.exe run from a one-shot `dotnet build`, and the Client is built once
    (`npm run build`) then served statically via `node vite.js preview`, with no file watcher or
    HMR involved at all.

    Nothing this instance does is ever promoted back to survive.db or the real Survive repo - stop
    it with test-instance-stop.ps1, which just tears everything down, no save.

.PARAMETER Port
    Port for the test MOO instance to listen on. Defaults to 7778 so it can run alongside the dev
    world (test.ps1's default MooPort 7777) at the same time.

.PARAMETER SidecarPort
    Port for the isolated Sidecar. Defaults to 5900.

.PARAMETER LspPort
    Port for the isolated LSP server. Defaults to 5950.

.PARAMETER ClientPort
    Port for the isolated Client static preview server. Defaults to 5199.

.PARAMETER LspBridgeMooPort
    Port the world's dedicated LSP-service listener binds to (see MOOdy's CLAUDE.md bootstrap
    docs) - distinct from Port, a different player character. Defaults to 7782 (test.ps1's own
    Survive profile already uses 7780).

# unrelated build already brought the shared obj/ cache up to date for the

# `dotnet test`, an IDE background compile), this step sees "nothing to do"
# and skips the copy, leaving a stale binary here indefinitely. `-t:Rebuild`
# forces a real recompile+copy every time without touching where `obj/`
# lives, so it doesn't reintroduce the `ProjectReference` breakage above.
