<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Starts just the MOO server (no Sidecar, no LSP server, no Client) against a given db file -
    for quickly poking at an arbitrary database without booting the full test.ps1 stack.

.DESCRIPTION
    Runs the ToastStunt submodule's built `moo` binary under WSL, in the foreground, against
    whatever -DbPath you point it at. On clean shutdown (in-game `;;shutdown();` or Ctrl+C), the
    resulting <db>.new is promoted over the original db file, same as test.ps1's own MOO server
    tab - so the next launch against the same -DbPath continues from where you left off.

    Defaults to port 7779 - deliberately distinct from test.ps1's default MooPort (7777) and
    test-instance-start.ps1's default Port (7778), so this can run alongside either without a
    collision.

.PARAMETER DbPath
    Path (relative or absolute) to the .db file to boot. Must already exist - this script doesn't
    seed one for you.

.PARAMETER Port
    Port for the MOO server to listen on. Default: 7779.

.PARAMETER TreeDir
    Optional path to a content tree to root FileIO at (the `-i` flag). Omitted by default - most
    ad hoc uses of this script don't need FileIO wired up at all.

.PARAMETER Emergency
    Passes `-e` (emergency wizard mode) - drops into the server's own interactive console
    (stdin/stdout, not the network port) before normal startup, for the one-time bootstrap recipe
    in MOOdy's own CLAUDE.md ("Bootstrap verbs baked into every world"): fixing #0's wizard/
    programmer flags and adding do_command/user_connected on a brand-new Minimal.db-derived world
    that has no eval path yet. Type `continue` in that console to exit emergency mode and proceed
    to normal startup against the same db - no restart needed.

.PARAMETER Bootstrap
    Requires -Emergency. Instead of leaving the emergency console's stdin attached to your
    terminal for interactive typing/pasting, writes the standard bootstrap recipe (the exact `;;`
    block from CLAUDE.md's "Bootstrap verbs baked into every world" section - #0's wizard/
    programmer flags, do_command, user_connected, do_start_script, then `continue`) to a temp file
    and redirects it onto moo's stdin from inside the `bash -c` command line (`< file`) - not
    piped in via PowerShell's own `|` operator, which was tried first and confirmed live to break
    Ctrl+C for the rest of the session (see the launch section's own comment for why). Exists
    because pasting that block by hand into a PowerShell -> wsl.exe -> raw-mode linenoise console
    has been confirmed live to silently drop/merge lines under paste speed, leaving several
    statements missing with no error - feeding it as file input instead delivers the exact bytes
    with no human paste step in between.

    Every step checks for its own prior work first (mirrors bootstrap-moo-world.ps1's own
    existence-check pattern) and notify()s which branch it took, visible live in the console
    output - safe to re-run against a world that's already partially or fully bootstrapped from
    an earlier attempt (e.g. one that got interrupted, or a restart against the same db).

.PARAMETER LspBridgePort
    Requires -Bootstrap. Also creates the LSP bridge's dedicated service character + listener
    object (see CLAUDE.md's "LSP service character + listener" section) bound to this port, the
    same objects bootstrap-moo-world.ps1's own -LspBridgePort would create - except that script
    can never reach a world bootstrapped this way at all (it only speaks the native single-`;`
    eval convention a real ToastCore world has built in; this recipe only installs the `;;` shim),
    so this is the only way to set that up for a bare Minimal.db-derived world. Must differ from
    -Port. Skipped (and left alone) if something's already listening on this port, so it's safe to
    re-run too.

.PARAMETER SkipValidate
    Passes the `moo` binary's own `--skip-validate` flag: skips the object-hierarchy validation
    pass on load. Only safe against a db already known-good (e.g. one that just finished a clean,
    fully-validated boot) - against a genuinely broken/cyclic object graph this trades a fast,
    clear failure at startup for a hang or crash the first time something actually walks the graph.

.PARAMETER ForceBinaryNotify
    Passes the `moo` binary's own `--force-binary-notify` flag: always decodes `~XX` binary-string
    escapes in notify() output for every connection, regardless of each connection's own "binary"
    option - reproduces the always-on behavior some other cores hard-code at the engine level,
    without changing the standard per-connection opt-in default for any other db built from this
    same binary.
