<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Starts Sidecar + LanguageServer + Client against an ALREADY-RUNNING MOO server (e.g. one
    started with start-moo-only.ps1) - isolated enough that multiple copies of this script can
    run side by side, against different worlds, with no port or build conflicts.

.DESCRIPTION
    Does NOT start or manage a MOO server at all - that's start-moo-only.ps1's job, run
    separately, once per world you want up. This script only wires Sidecar/LanguageServer/Client
    up to whichever already-running MOO instance you point it at.

    Runs in the foreground; Ctrl+C stops all three child processes cleanly. One terminal window
    per concurrent instance, same shape as start-moo-only.ps1's own foreground/Ctrl+C pattern -
    no separate stop script to remember.

    Isolation strategy - what's shared vs. what's unique per invocation:
    - Sidecar.exe / LanguageServer.exe / the Fable-compiled Client JS (`output/`) are all
      content-deterministic - same source in, same binary/JS out, regardless of which MOO
      instance you later point them at via CLI args/env vars. These are BUILT ONCE into a shared
      `bin\ide-stack\` / `output\` location and safely reused/rebuilt-in-place across every
      concurrent or sequential invocation - a named Mutex serializes just the build steps
      themselves, so two invocations starting at the same moment don't race on the same
      obj/bin/output files (confirmed against test-instance-start.ps1's own doc comment: the
      `LanguageServer -> Metadata -> Language` ProjectReference resolution breaks if
      BaseIntermediateOutputPath is also isolated, so `obj/` deliberately stays shared - that's
      exactly the directory a concurrent, unsynchronized `dotnet build` could corrupt).
    - The Vite BUILD output is different - `VITE_SIDECAR_WS_URL`/`VITE_LSP_WS_URL`/
      `VITE_DATABASE_NAME` are baked into the bundle at `vite build` time via
      `import.meta.env` (confirmed in App.fs), so two instances pointed at different MOO
      targets genuinely need different bundles. Each invocation gets its own `--outDir`,
      keyed by its own auto-picked Client port - never shared, never mutex-protected, just
      structurally unique.
    - Sidecar/LSP/Client's own HTTP ports are auto-picked free ports (bind to port 0, read back
      what the OS assigned, release it) - never fixed defaults, so N concurrent invocations never
      collide with each other or with test.ps1/test-instance-start.ps1's own fixed port sets.
      Small accepted race: another process could grab the port in the moment between releasing
      the probe listener and the real service binding it - same trade-off every "find a free
      port" helper makes.
    - Logs and PIDs are named after the auto-picked Sidecar port, so concurrent runs' logs never
      overwrite each other either.

    Also re-binds the world's dedicated LSP-service listener (`listen(#LspListenerObj,
    LspBridgeMooPort)`) every run, wrapped in a MOO try/except - it doesn't persist across a MOO
    server restart (confirmed live, same as MOOdy's CLAUDE.md documents for test.ps1's own
    profiles), and start-moo-only.ps1 doesn't do this itself. The listener object's number isn't
    assumed to be any fixed value (unlike MOO-World's own #5) - a world bootstrapped via
    bootstrap-moo-world.ps1 gets a dynamically-created object number instead, so -LspListenerObj
    must be passed explicitly.

.PARAMETER MooHost
    Host the MOO server is listening on. Default: 127.0.0.1.

.PARAMETER MooPort
    Port the already-running MOO server (e.g. from start-moo-only.ps1) is listening on. No
    default - always pass it explicitly.

.PARAMETER LspBridgeMooPort
    Port the world's dedicated LSP-service listener is bound to (see MOOdy's CLAUDE.md "LSP
    service character + listener" section). Must already have been bootstrapped once on this
    world (bootstrap-moo-world.ps1's -LspBridgePort, or test.ps1's own profile) - this script
    only re-binds listen() on restart, it doesn't create the objects/verbs.

.PARAMETER LspListenerObj
    Object number of that listener (e.g. 5 on MOO-World; whatever bootstrap-moo-world.ps1
    reported as `lst` for another world).

.PARAMETER MooUser
    Username to log in as on $MooPort when (re-)binding the LSP-service listener - the *only*
    step in this script that talks to the world's real player port at all (the export step below
    routes through the listener port instead, which logs in as its own dedicated service
    character unconditionally regardless of what's sent - see that step's own comment). Defaults
    to "wizard", which is correct as-is for a bare Minimal.db-derived world (no real accounting -
    any text logs in as Wizard). A world with real per-account accounting (confirmed live against
    MOO-World once it gained one) needs its actual wizard-equivalent account name here instead,
    or the listen() call silently never runs (wrapped in try/except) and the listener never binds
    - the LSP's own /lsp-bridge connections then fail immediately (connection refused), which is
    what starves the MOOcode docs panel/hover of any live data.

.PARAMETER MooPassword
    Password for -MooUser, only needed when that account has a real, non-blank one. Passed as a
    plain script argument rather than hardcoded, by design - keeps a real credential out of any
    git-tracked file. Omit (default: empty) for a passwordless account, including every bare
    Minimal.db-derived world's default "wizard".

.PARAMETER TreeDir
    Content tree for this MOO world (Moo:TreeDir) - where the Sidecar exports/reads/commits
    MOOcode. Must already exist.

.PARAMETER RefreshExport
    Forces a full `Sidecar.exe export` even if TreeDir already has a content tree. Omit for the
    normal case: once a tree exists, this script skips the export entirely and starts straight
    from what's already on disk - confirmed live that a full export against a large real-world
    database (~633k objects) can take 30+ minutes (see the "Large real-world database
    performance" kanban card), so re-running it unconditionally on every single launch is not
    something day-to-day IDE starts should pay for. Most live edits made *through* the IDE
    already keep the tree in sync incrementally on their own (`IdeActions.fs`'s per-object
    live-save re-export) without needing this. Reach for -RefreshExport when the world was
    changed some other way since the tree was last exported - a manual `.program`/telnet edit
    bypassing the Sidecar entirely, or a genuinely fresh TreeDir being pointed at content that
    already has history elsewhere.

.PARAMETER ClientPort
    Pins the browser Client to this fixed port instead of an auto-picked one. Omit to keep the
    default auto-pick behavior (a free port, never colliding with a concurrent instance) - only
    reach for this when you specifically want the same URL/origin across restarts. Sidecar and
    LSP stay auto-picked either way; only the Client's port is user-facing in a way that matters
    here, since browser localStorage (tab-session restore, tree filter settings, etc.) is scoped
    to the page's own origin, which includes the port - a fresh random port every launch means a
    fresh, empty origin every time, silently losing whatever was stored there. Throws up front if
    the port is already in use, same as `start-moo-only.ps1`'s own `-Port` check.
